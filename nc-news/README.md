# Northcoders News

## Overview

Northcoders News is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion platform, with articles divided into topics. Each article has user-curated ratings from upvotes and downvotes. Additionally, users can add comments about an article.

This project showcases the culmination of skills acquired by Oswaldo Colon Freites during the Northcoders Software Development Bootcamp. The aim is to demonstrate a proficiency in various technologies and techniques that are relevant to the software development industry.

### Development Journey:

1. **Backend Development**: A RESTful API was crafted to set the foundation for all necessary requests to interact with the project's database. This used Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, with test suites constructed using Supertest and Jest.

2. **Frontend Planning**: By employing wireframing concepts and component tree diagrams, a clear vision of the app's structure emerged. This phase determined the optimal infrastructure for the app and defined the state for component interactions.

3. **Frontend Implementation**: Components were meticulously crafted to harness the full potential of the API endpoints. Focus was maintained on user experience, performance efficiency, and component reusability.

4. **Error Handling**: Robustness was ensured with thorough error handling, which enhanced user experience. Alerts and messages were integrated to keep the user informed in various scenarios.

5. **Styling and Responsiveness**: A modern, intuitive, and user-friendly interface was sculpted, ensuring accessibility and seamless responsiveness across various devices.

6. **Documentation**: Detailed technical documentation and usage instructions were crafted, ensuring clarity for developers and users alike.
